Instead of sharing music or video these files simply direct the user to a web page from where, they are promised, they can download a free media player.They will then install the PLAY_MP3.EXE executable, which, when run, installs the Downloader-UA.h downloader.

The promised media player then turns out to be a web-based player which offers only a limited range of saved tracks.As a note on naming, trojans may have different versions of themselves, each with a different name and possibly slightly different behavior.
