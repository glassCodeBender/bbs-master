##Mac OS Installation Instructions

NOTE: These instructions assume you don't know very much.
OTHER NOTE: THESE ARE INCOMPLETE BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS INCOMPLETE.
            The reason I wrote the instructions now is because I had to reinstall Mac OS.

Install Anaconda (From continuum analytics)
- Google search for "python Anaconda". 
- Anaconda is a super easy package and environment manager.
- You might as well install python 3.6 because we will create a python 2.7 environment.

Create Python 2 Environment
~$ conda create -n py2 python=2.7.13 anaconda

Install Java 8 (NOT Java 9)

Install Intellij Idea (When you run it, make sure to install Scala package)

Open the Intellij Idea Projects Directory
~$ cd IdeaProjects/bbs 

Grab Big Brain Security Project from GitHub
~$ git clone 

Install Homebrew

~$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl –fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
Install Scala (this allows you to run Scala from the command line, but it’s not necessary)
~$ brew install scala 

Install SBT 
~$ brew install sbt@1

~$ brew install yara
NOTE: If you run your computer as a local user, you’ll need to log in to your administrator account to run this command. 
~$ pip install distorm3
~$ pip install yara-python
~$ pip install pil
~$ pip install openpyxl

Install volatility and create volatility directory
~$ git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility.git

Open the volatility directory
~$ cd volatility 
Place Any Memory Images in the Volatility Directory
