##Mac OS Installation Instructions

            The reason I wrote the instructions now is because I had to reinstall Mac OS.

Install Anaconda (From continuum analytics)
- Google search for "python Anaconda". 
- Anaconda is a super easy package and environment manager.
- You might as well install python 3.6 because we will create a python 2.7 environment.

Create Python 2 Environment
~$ conda create -n py2 python=2.7.13 anaconda

Install Java 8 (NOT Java 9)

Install Intellij Idea (When you run it, make sure to install Scala package)

Open the Intellij Idea Projects Directory
~$ cd IdeaProjects/bbs-master 

Grab Big Brain Security Project from GitHub
~$ git clone 

Install Homebrew

~$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl –fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
Install Scala (this allows you to run Scala from the command line, but it’s not necessary)
~$ brew install scala 
  
Install SBT 
~$ brew install sbt@1

~$ brew install yara
NOTE: If you run your computer as a local user, you’ll need to log in to your administrator account to run this command. 
~$ pip install distorm3
~$ pip install yara-python
~$ pip install pil
~$ pip install openpyxl

Install volatility and create volatility directory
~$ git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility.git

Activate Python 2 Environment 
~$ source activate py2 

Download the bbs-master source code from github www.github.com/glassCodeBender/bbs-master

Open bbs-master in Intellij Idea (To make sure all the dependencies are installed).

Open a terminal and cd to wherever you stored the bbs-master directory after you downloaded it.

Run SBT Assembly to compile the computer program
~$ sbt assembly

A jar file will be created called bigbrainsecurity.jar. 
- The exact location of the jar will be written to the terminal after the jar is compiled. 

Open to the directory holding bigbrainsecurity.jar (cd) and move the jar to the volatility directory. 
- You will call the Scala program directly out of the volatility directory (where vol.py) is located.

Inside the bbs-master directory there are a bunch of .yar and .yara files. 
- Move (or copy) all of the .yar and .yara files to the volatility directory.

Now move to the volatility directory.
~$ cd volatility 

Place any memory dumps in the Volatility Directory also.

Fill out the bbs_config.txt file to let the program know the name of the memory dump you are importing and the operating system of the memory dump. 

bbs_config.txt will be located in the bbs-master directory, but it also needs to move to the volatility directory. 

Run program out of the volatility directory. 
~$ scala bigbrainsecurity.jar
